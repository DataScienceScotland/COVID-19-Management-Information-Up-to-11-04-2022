# COVID-19-Management-Information

Since spring 2020, the Scottish Government has been publishing daily COVID-19 management information on the Scottish government website. These include figures for daily data and past data and trend charts for the daily updates on COVID-19. Both of these webpages are updated every day 7 days a week, with latest available information.

* Daily data: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-daily-data-for-scotland/
* Past data: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-trends-in-daily-data/

The data here provide past data for the daily updates provided for information and re-use in a high quality, well described technical form. This platform is distinct from the Public Health Scotland open data website. 

These datasets contain historic trend data, which have been kept as published open data for transparency purposes. The currently published datasets as open data include:

* The daily number of people in hospital with recently confirmed in Scotland
* Daily delayed discharges
* Reported number of COVID-19 tests and number of new cases reported in Scotland.
* Cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed deaths registered to date
* Daily attendance and absence in schools in Scotland.

It is Management Information, which is collected and distributed each day in order to support understanding of the progress of the outbreak in Scotland. The information comes from different administrative systems and as such there may be variations in the quality of the data and is subject to revision if new information becomes available.
