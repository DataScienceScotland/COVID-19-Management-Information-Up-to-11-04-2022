# Project setup (GitHub)

If you have an existing "COVID-19-Management-Information" project, it would probably be best to delete it before continuing. This will avoid the confusion of having two projects with the same name.

1. Open RStudio.
2. From the top menu, select File > New Project > Version Control > Git
3. In the pop-up window, copy "https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/COVID-19-Management-Information" into the Repository URL field.
4. Project directory name will auto-populate.
5. Browse to the directory you want to create the project in for "Create project as a subdirectory of"
6. Tick open in a new session
7. Click create project
